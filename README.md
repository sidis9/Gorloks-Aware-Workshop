# Gorloks-Aware-Workshop
This repo contains my presentation for International Education Week, where I spoke as a Gorloks Aware Student Ambassador. The slides cover key topics like interpersonal violence, consent, cultural perspectives, bystander intervention (Green Dot), trauma-informed support, and campus/community resources.
